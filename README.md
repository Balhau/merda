# Mark, Enrich, Research Design and Assurance (MERDA)

## Introduction

Nowadays millions of line of code are written every year. Lots of it are crap. The quality is so poor that the mere thinking of it should be forbidden. Hence Mark, Enrich, Research Design and Assurance **MERDA**. So this project is all about quality of code. We all know that our codebase should be treated like a Bonsai, not as a sack of shit. This lib is a Java component we can use in our projects to help mitigate the widespread use of shitty code.
